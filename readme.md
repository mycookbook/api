# Installation

Use the make command to setup the project like so:

```angular2html
make install
```

This command spins up containers, install project dependencies, creates a barebone  .env file which you can update as needed, sets the app key etc
For a full glossary of all the make commands, look in the `Makefile` in the project root.
