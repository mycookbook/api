            We use your Personal Data to provide our Services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you create an account through the Services and become a Registered User or

            and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Cookbook and its users. Other Information. Other Information will be considered Personal Data if it is
            combined with other data in such a way that enables you to be identified. However, where Other Information is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information,
            it will not be treated as Personal Data. We may use Other Information for any purpose, unless prohibited by law. We may combine your Personal Data with Other Information and
            aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze

            automatically record information that your browser or mobile device sends or transmits ("Usage Information"). This Usage Information may include information such as your
            computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site or the App that you visit (or of the
            site you visited that had the Cookbook feature), the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, the model and device ID number of your
            mobile device, user settings, location (if you enable this feature), and statistics and information about your use of the Site and App. We use this information to provide and
            improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you. We also use Usage Information to monitor and analyze use of the

            and to better tailor our Services to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you revisit the Services,
            we will recognize you and can serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Some of the Usage Information (like your IP address) is Personal Data.
        </p> <label data-v-e6f6acd0="">Cookies</label> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            Cookies. Like many websites, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons, APIs and similar technologies to collect Usage Information. Pixels and web beacons are small pieces of code
            placed on web pages and content that communicate when the page or content has been viewed. A cookie is a small data file that your browser places on your computer that helps
            us understand how you interact with the Site and use our Services. We use two types of cookies. We use persistent cookies to save information like your search preferences,

            you may not be able to use all portions of or all functionality of our Services. We also use other parties (including Google Analytics) to provide usage analytics for our
            Services. These other parties will place their own cookies to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver us relevant metrics and information.

            to use any social network features such as the Facebook "Like" button and other widgets, such as a "share" button or interactive mini-programs that we may offer through the

            Other Parties’ Apps and Services.
        </label> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            You can choose to integrate our App with a variety of other parties’ apps and services. If you do, we will share information with, and receive information from,

                If you use our App with compatible services or retailers, such as grocery stores, grocery delivery, or food delivery services, we may exchange information about your geographic location, food preferences, and ingredient choices.

        </label> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            In certain situations, Cookbook may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
            enforcement requirements. Cookbook cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any
            information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims

            5. International Transfers
        </label> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            The Services are offered globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will be transferred to and processed in
            the United States where our servers are located. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in
            your country. We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer Personal Data internationally. These include your consent, EU Commission approved model contractual clauses
            (which require certain privacy and security protections), and the Privacy Shield Frameworks described below. Cookbook is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it
            receives under the Privacy Shield Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Cookbook complies with the Privacy Shield Principles
            for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to Personal Data received or
            transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Cookbook is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. If you have an unresolved
            privacy or data use concern related to the Privacy Shield Framework that you believe we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute
            resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield

This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where you allege that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it; <br data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            - object to the processing, wholly or partly, of your Personal Data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; <br data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            - where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data, you can revoke the consent to the processing of your Personal Data freely and at any time, and also opt-out of marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe option at the bottom of our marketing communications; or <br data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            - make your Personal Data available to you or to a different provider in some circumstances. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that Personal Data we process based on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) may not be portable.
        </p> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">If you wish to manage your data as described above, or raise any questions about the Personal Data we hold about you, please contact us using the contact information below.
            There is generally no charge for you to exercise any of the data management options described in this section, but we may charge a reasonable fee if you make excessive or
            unfounded requests. In some cases, depending on where you live, you have the right to lodge a complaint in front of the competent national data protection or judicial
            authority if you object to how we use your Personal Data.

        </label> <p data-v-e6f6acd0="">
            CookbooksHQ is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from
            unauthorized access; however, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any
            interception or other type of misuse. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any
            account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the Contact Us section below.
