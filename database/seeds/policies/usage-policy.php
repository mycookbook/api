            This policy describes expected users' code of conduct either as an anonymous user or as a contributor.
            It also describes some key features and functionalities of the app and advises where user's discretion is required.
            By using this site, you have agreed to adhere to the&nbsp;<a href="/#/terms-and-conditions" title="CookbooksHQ Terms &amp; Conditions. Property of cookbookshq.com">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>,
            Usage Policy and&nbsp;<a href="/#/data-retention-policy" title="Cookbooks HQ Data Retention Policy. Property of cookbookshq.com">Data Retention Policy</a>.
            We retain the right to delete your contents, block your contributor account or take any legal
            actions as we deem fit upon any violation of any part of this policy.
        </p> <p>
            A contributor is a user that has to be authenticated before they can access the admin app. As a contributor,
            you are expected to only submit your original content. Copying contents you don't own from another recipe website is
            unacceptable and a complete violation of our code of conduct. You must strive to be authentic with your submissions.
            The more authentic you are, the better this site becomes, and more users trust us. If any of your contents is reported as a duplicate,
            inappropriate or stolen, on our part, we will carry out an investigation and send you an email. You have the right to defend your content.
            But if you are found wanting, the content may be deleted from our servers or any other action may be taken as we deem fit.
            If your contents get reported up to a total of 3 times throughout your lifecycle as a contributor on this platform, we will have to take
            appropriate actions as we deem fit. This may involve deleting your account permanently and barring you from using this platform in the future.
        </p> <p>
            As a contributor, other users might submit varieties to your recipes. These will be in a pending state and will not show up on the
            platform unless you approve them. You have a right to decide which varieties should be approved or not. When you decline a variety,
            it gets permanently deleted from our servers. However, regarding our&nbsp;<a href="/#/data-retention-policy" title="Cookbooks HQ Data Retention Policy. Property of cookbookshq.com">data retention policy</a>,
            we have the right to keep your contributions on our servers as any submissions made to this platform is technically our property.
            You can request for your contents including your user account to be permanently deleted. Note that this request may take up to
            90 days to take effect fully.
        </p> <p>
            An anonymous user is a user that does not have to be authenticated to search for any recipes on this platform.
            You also cannot access the admin app. If you wish to make a submission, hit the register link to create an account.
        </p> <p>
            As an anonymous user, you have access to all the cookbooks, recipes and varieties on this platform and you can access them anonymously and for no fee atall.
            You have the right to submit varieties too without the need to be authenticated.
        </p> <div class="ui small header">
            Calorie counter
        </div> <p>The calorie count for each recipe submitted is calculated using our internal <span title="Property of cookbookshq.com">calorie counter tool</span>. It takes into consideration the calorie count in each
            of the ingredients provided by the author of the recipe and returns the sum/average. About 90% of the time this value will be true however it is highly dependent on
            the ingredients provided by the author. It may not reflect the true calorie count if:
        <ol><li>
                There was a spelling error in the name of the ingredient.
            </li> <li>
                The ingredients list is incomplete.
            </li> <li>
                The ingredients list is not a true reflection of what actually went into preparing the recipe/variety.
            </li></ol>
        In these scenarios, user's discretion is advised. The CookbookHQ admin app provides a way to help contributors provide accurate information regarding a submission they are making.
        </p> <div class="ui small header">
            Comparisons
        </div> <p>
            Recipe or varieties comparisons are only possible for recipes that belong to the same cookbook and varieties that belong to the same recipe. Comparisons are based
            on the calories count of the items being compared. This helps the user have a quick glance at the nutritional detail of different recipes or varieties of a recipe. Again,
            user's discretion is advised.
        </p> <div class="ui small header">
            Reporting
        </div> <p>
            You have the right to report a recipe that you deem inappropriate, stolen or a duplicate by using the&nbsp;
